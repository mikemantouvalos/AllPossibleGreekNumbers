The application should ask the user for a number, and then present the identified number back to the user.
The application should accept as input a sequence of numbers separated by a space char. Each number in
the input sequence may be up to a three digit number. This input represents recognized numbers that a user
may pronounce. For example, possible inputs may be:
input example: 30 2 5 58
input example: 2 10 69 30 6 60 4
input example: 6 97 400 23 7 40 5
Then the application should identify and print the input number.
For example, if input is: 30 2 5 58, output should be: 302558
If input is: 2 10 69 30 6 60 4, output should be: 21069306604
